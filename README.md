Gem Hunters is a simple console-based game where two players compete to collect gems on a grid-based board while avoiding obstacles. Each player takes turns moving their character around the board, trying to collect as many gems as possible within a limited number of turns.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game is played on a square grid board with randomly placed gems and obstacles.
2. **Players**: There are two players, Player 1 and Player 2, denoted as "P1" and "P2" respectively on the board.
3. **Objective**: The objective of each player is to collect as many gems as possible.
4. **Turns**: Players take turns to move their characters on the board.
5. **Movement**: Players can move their characters up, down, left, or right on the board.
6. **Gems**: Gems are represented by "G" on the board. When a player moves onto a tile containing a gem, they collect it.
7. **Obstacles**: Obstacles are represented by "O" on the board. Players cannot move onto tiles containing obstacles.
8. **Winning**: The game ends when either:
   - One player collects a certain number of gems, or
   - The total number of turns reaches a certain limit.
9. **Winner**: The player with the most gems at the end of the game is declared the winner.
